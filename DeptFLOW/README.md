### IMPORTANT: Discord Bot Configuration
Before running the bot, you MUST enable privileged intents:
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Click on "Bot" in the left sidebar
4. Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"
5. Enable ALL of the following:
   - Message Content Intent
   - Server Members Intent
   - Presence Intent
6. Click "Save Changes"

### VS Code Setup
1. Clone or download the project files:
   - bot.py
   - database.py
   - .env (create this)
   - README.md

2. Open the project in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code discord-webhook-bot
   ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py python-dotenv aiohttp
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Discord bot token:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

6. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

### VS Code Extensions (Recommended)
- Python (Microsoft)
- Python Environment Manager
- SQLite Viewer
- Discord Presence
- Prettier - Code formatter

## Files Structure

- `bot.py` - Main bot code
- `database.py` - Database handler
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `webhooks.db` - SQLite database (created automatically)

## Required Permissions

The bot needs the following permissions:
- Read Messages/View Channels
- Send Messages
- Manage Webhooks
- Embed Links

## Development Tips

1. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Use the built-in debugger with F5
   - Set breakpoints by clicking the line number
   - Watch variables in the debug console

2. Database Management:
   - Use VS Code's SQLite Viewer extension to inspect the database
   - Keep backups of webhooks.db if needed

3. Environment Variables:
   - Use python-dotenv for local development
   - Keep .env in .gitignore

## Troubleshooting

If the bot fails to start:
1. Verify Privileged Intents are enabled in the Discord Developer Portal
   - All three intents (Message Content, Server Members, Presence) must be enabled
   - Changes may take a few minutes to propagate
2. Check your bot token is correct and up to date
3. Try regenerating the bot token if issues persist
4. Ensure you've installed all required dependencies

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check if privileged intents are enabled
2. Verify the bot token is correct
3. Ensure all required permissions are granted
4. Check Python version compatibility
5. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
